## About
This project is a web solution that allows users to **manage** information related to **persons**, **land holdings**, and **land plots**.
It provides features such as **creating**, **reviewing**, and **correcting objects**, as well as **viewing summary** information of all objects.
Users can see a list of persons and their total area of property, and then open the list of personal property. 
They can also view a list of properties and property plots, including the total area and distribution of land use by area.
Additionally, the solution allows users to **filter** incomplete data such as **persons without properties**, **properties without land plots**, and **land plots without land uses**.
Overall, the solution aims to streamline the management of these objects and provide users with a comprehensive view of their data.
